One notable aspect is the use of layer blending for the intricate texturing of the screwdriver handle. By carefully layering different textures and adjusting their blending modes, I achieved a realistic and tactile appearance, enhancing the overall quality of the model.\nFurthermore, I employed photorealistic lighting techniques and physics simulations to ensure accurate placement of objects within the scene. This added a sense of realism by mimicking how light interacts with the surfaces of the screw and screwdriver, as well as how they would naturally behave when manipulated. The combination of these techniques resulted in a visually striking and technically impressive representation of the screw and screwdriver, showcasing my skills as a 3D artist.",
